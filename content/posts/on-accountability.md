Accountability in today's society. Due to an increase in population in human societies, especially cities, we see people trying to focus on their privacy and make select, sometimes not so slelect, relationships. This is because people we know and build relationships with "hold us accountable" for things we say.
People avoid relationships with people close to them habitually due accountability. This creates a vicious cricle. However, the solution for the city's man is to take accountability for select things and his failures.
